\f0\fs32 \cf2 To help you digitize or incorporate this into your doctoral work, I\'92ve structured the worksheet into a clear, functional template. This format is designed to mirror the flow of an ICS-209 or a Spot Weather Forecast, focusing on the "Single Points of Failure" and "Administrative Capacity" themes of your research.\
Wildland Fire Behavior Analysis Template\
I. Incident Overview\
| Field | Data Entry |\
|---|---|\
| Incident Name: |  |\
| Observer (FF Name): |  |\
| Date / Time: |  |\
| Current Perimeter: | (Reference Sketch A) |\
| Expected Growth: | (Reference Sketch B) |\
II. Critical Environmental Inputs\
These variables represent the "Raw Data" required for administrative decision-making (e.g., evacuation triggers).\
 * Relative Humidity (RH): ___%\
 * Fuel Profile:\
   * [ ] Litter (sfc): Surface fuels/detritus.\
   * [ ] Grass (sfc): Fine fuels, rapid ignition.\
   * [ ] Crown (aer): Potential for torching/active crown fire.\
III. Wind & Slope Dynamics (The EWS Calculation)\
Effective Wind Speed (EWS) is the critical metric for calculating the "push" on a fire.\
| Wind Metric | Observed | Predicted (20/EL) |\
|---|---|---|\
| Eye-Level WS |  |  |\
| Mid-Flame WS |  |  |\
| Slope Contribution | + | + |\
| Total EWS | = | = |\
> Note: EWS Ratio = \\frac\{\\text\{Big EWS\}\}\{\\text\{Small EWS\}\} (Determines the scaling factor for the Rate of Spread).\
> \
IV. Rate of Spread (ROS) Projections\
 * Observed Spread: ___________ (Chains/hr or ft/min)\
 * ROS Ratio: [ ] Faster \\downarrow | [ ] Slower \\downarrow\
 * Final Calculation:\
   * V. Operational Observations Log\
| Time | Fire Behavior Notes | Weather Trends (Temp/RH/Wind) |\
|---|---|---|\
|  |  |  |\
|  |  |  |\
VI. Mandatory Safety Audit\
ENSURE LCES:\
 * Lookouts: Positioned with a view of the hazards and the crew.\
 * Communications: Radio frequencies confirmed and tested.\
 * Escape Routes: At least two cleared paths to safety.\
 * Safety Zones: Large enough to survive without a fire shelter.\
Academic Integration for Your Doctorate\
If you are looking at Administrative Capacity in Stockton or mid-sized urban centers, this worksheet is a prime example of "Standardized Operational Intelligence."\
A "Single Point of Failure" in this context often occurs when:\
 * The Data-to-Decision pipeline breaks (e.g., field observations like this aren't reaching the EOC in real-time).\
 * Administrative gaps prevent the rapid acquisition of resources (e.g., Type 3 engines) even when the ROS math clearly dictates a need.\
